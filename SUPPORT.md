===========

Movement and Meaning Middleware (also known as m+m) is a software system that acts as an intermediary between
subsystems that provide sensor data, such as accelerometers and motion capture cameras, and actuators such as projectors and sound systems. It provides mechanisms for reporting and interrogating the protocols used by the sensors and actuators, as well as a standard architecture for creating services.
