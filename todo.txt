Hi Norm,

Just to let you know the updated code works. Just some minor notes:

- in M+MCommon.h I changed 

#if defined( MAC_OR_LINUX_)
#include yarp logger...

to

#if MAC_OR_LINUX_

as the former still causes the include in windows.

- ScannerThread and ChannelManagerApp.cpp files still had the #include for yarp logger; I've windows-commented them out using #if ! mac_or_linux_, but we can probably take it out completely? (since I see it's included in M+MCommon.h and has the appropriate check in place already)
