[notation: ‘=‘ universal, ‘+’ service viewer / channel manager, ‘*’ M+M, ‘@‘ manual]

= use selected inclusion of ODEnableLogging/ODLogging, ODDisableLogging/ODLogging to bracket code that needs to be logged

* change signal handling to use platform-neutral mechanisms

+ on dragging, do an adjustSize() without repaint?

* Python, Lua, Tcl (, Common Lisp?) services

* integrate Arduino sensors via Linux-based Arduino boards? SmartTag via TouchShare?

— check if older compiler works OK —> no, not compatible with current Spidermonkey
— check if linker can be told to ignore duplicates —> can’t build JavaScript service on Windows, so moot
— if new compiler is ‘just broken’, change documentation back to old compiler, don’t build JavaScript for Windows
