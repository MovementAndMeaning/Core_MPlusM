+ for ACE - after building, do a ‘sudo sh’ for installing - and make sure to do ‘export ACE_ROOT=$(pwd)’ and ‘export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=????:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH’ if the install directory is not /usr/local

+ for YARP - unset ACE_ROOT before doing a fresh ‘ccmake ..’, so that the /opt/M+M files will be picked, not the ACE_ROOT ones

+ on dragging, do an adjustSize() without repaint?

+ if a connection is made outside of the viewer / manager, make sure that a repaint is triggered, not just for a new entity
