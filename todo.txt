[notation: ‘=‘ universal, ‘+’ channel manager, ‘*’ M+M, ‘@‘ manual]

= use selected inclusion of ODEnableLogging/ODLogging, ODDisableLogging/ODLogging to bracket code that needs to be logged

* change signal handling to use platform-neutral mechanisms

+ on dragging, do an adjustSize() without repaint?

+ if a connection is made outside of the viewer / manager, make sure that a repaint is triggered, not just for a new entity

* ‘touchShare’ protocol with iOS devices?

* Python, Lua, Tcl (, Common Lisp?) services

* integrate Arduino sensors via Linux-based Arduino boards? SmartTag via TouchShare?

* Tunnel Service and Client need to be bidirectional (use nonblocking I/O?)

- check if the SpiderMonkey library can be statically linked on Windows and if this resolves the exit issue; if so, check if it can be statically linked on OS X

= to determine whether a Windows executable is 32-bit or 64-bit, do “c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\vc\bin\dumpbin.exe /headers the-program-file.exe”

+ configuration file should have ‘enabled’, ‘name’, ‘arguments’, where ‘enabled’ is 0 if disabled, non-0 if enabled, ‘name’ is the executable name, et cetera - tab-separated

+ ‘load’ a configuration brings up the configuration editor, with a ‘start’ button, ‘edit’ a configuration, ‘save’ a configuration

* empty optional arguments in the GUI should be filled in with their default values before launch, and empty mandatory arguments should be reported

* services need to respond to a new request that returns their original launch parameters, so that these can be recorded

+ clicking on an adapter should change the text to ‘adapter’

+ a ‘forced’ connection should not use the I/O thickness, and should be ‘dashed’

+ I/O standard ports should be considered to be ‘O’ only, so that disconnecting them will work

@ ‘service’ manuals should have images of the settings dialogs, as well as an ‘active’ image from the GUI - these should be in the main manual as well, for the example and standard services

* suppress the make options for NaturalPoint, Unreal, Vicon, et cetera - for non-Windows builds of I/O services and for Unreal - by not showing the options and forcing them to OFF; make sure that the configuration file has macros for every one and that every I/O service is controlled by a flag
