[notation: ‘=‘ universal, ‘+’ service viewer / channel manager, ‘*’ M+M, ‘@‘ manual]

= use selected inclusion of ODEnableLogging/ODLogging, ODDisableLogging/ODLogging to bracket code that needs to be logged

+ when copying OGDF files into /usr/local/* from _release, use ‘cp -rp’ so that permissions will allow reading!
[_release/libOGDF.a goes to /usr/local/lib, ogdf/* goes to /usr/local/include]; note that the linker has some issues with OGDF
[do a make cleanrelease && make release, make cleandebug && make debug, this build libOGDF.a in
_release and _debug]

* change signal handling to use platform-neutral mechanisms

+ on dragging, do an adjustSize() without repaint?

+ if a connection is made outside of the viewer / manager, make sure that a repaint is triggered, not just for a new entity
