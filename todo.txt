* use selected inclusion of ODEnableLogging/ODLogging, ODDisableLogging/ODLogging to bracket code that needs to be logged

* shift-drag to draw line between first port and (free-floating) mouse point; bezier control line from mouse point to closest port other than the first port => note that connection is established when release occurs on another port, not via second click; release on same port of no port stops the drag with no connection made
