[notation: ‘=‘ universal, ‘+’ service viewer / channel manager, ‘*’ M+M, ‘@‘ manual]

= use selected inclusion of ODEnableLogging/ODLogging, ODDisableLogging/ODLogging to bracket code that needs to be logged

+ when copying OGDF files into /usr/local/* from _release, use ‘cp -rp’ so that permissions will allow reading!
[_release/libOGDF.a goes to /usr/local/lib, ogdf/* goes to /usr/local/include]; note that the linker has some issues with OGDF

+ load/save positions, by entity name [optional???]

* change signal handling to use platform-neutral mechanisms

* document the architecture, philosophy and API of the non-viewer code

+ on dragging, do an adjustSize() without repaint?

+ if a connection is made outside of the viewer / manager, make sure that a repaint is triggered, not just for a new entity


db integration - start on Tuesday, add a database service to accept file name, attributes and store in a MySQL database [if MySQL is too far from SQLite, use SQLite for now]; client class simply generates the ‘accept’ call; a command-line tool can then package the file name and attributes for the client object. An adapter could gather sequential data and write to a disk file, using a client object to push the data to the service
