[notation: ‘=‘ universal, ‘+’ service viewer, ‘*’ M+M]

= use selected inclusion of ODEnableLogging/ODLogging, ODDisableLogging/ODLogging to bracket code that needs to be logged

+ use ‘yarp clean —timeout 3’ logic for port exploration or send the ‘clean’ command to yarp before scanning

+ note that selecting an entity after connecting other entities sometimes causes the new entity to jump!

+ when copying OGDF files into /usr/local/*, use ‘cp -rp’ so that permissions will allow reading!

+ load/save positions, by entity name [optional???]

* change signal handling to use platform-neutral mechanisms

* a port has a corresponding protocols; ‘normal’ services can, of course, have secondary inputs and outputs - ’non-normal’ services respond to ‘protocol’ requests for their ports, as well as ‘restartStreams’, ‘startStreams’ and ‘stopStreams’ requests

—> note that the Service Registry already acts like an input… so it may not be necessary to add a new request but, rather, generalize what is already working

* random number stream service; start [# per packet [interval]] / stop; output protocol is ‘d’

* recorder service; start [file-name] / stop; input protocol is ‘i’

* general channels should have protocols -> if not specified (blank) anything goes; the Service Registry status port can have a protocol of ’s’ - protocols are just strings; get/set protocol, getProtocol request

* truncate filter; input protocol is ‘d’, output protocol is ‘i’
