= use selected inclusion of ODEnableLogging/ODLogging, ODDisableLogging/ODLogging to bracket code that needs to be logged

* change signal handling to use platform-neutral mechanisms

+ on dragging, do an adjustSize() without repaint?

>> for the bridge service, use the endpoint IP address to set the ‘listen’ socket; validate the IP address and port arguments (also for Address service) - note that the arguments are for the Vicon server (or other TCP/IP ‘raw’ port)
>> the bridge client only needs to have the port that it will set its ‘listen’ socket to; the connection to the service will provide the IP address and port for the ‘raw’ socket to talk to, and the client only needs to connect, without specifying its own address
