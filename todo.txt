[notation: ‘=‘ universal, ‘+’ service viewer, ‘*’ M+M]

= use selected inclusion of ODEnableLogging/ODLogging, ODDisableLogging/ODLogging to bracket code that needs to be logged

+ use ‘yarp clean —timeout 3’ logic for port exploration or send the ‘clean’ command to yarp before scanning

+ note that selecting an entity after connecting other entities sometimes causes the new entity to jump!

+ when copying OGDF files into /usr/local/*, use ‘cp -rp’ so that permissions will allow reading!

+ load/save positions, by entity name [optional???]

* change signal handling to use platform-neutral mechanisms

* add ‘kind’ to services, along with a new request to get the service ‘kind’ or add it to the service description; ‘kind’ is ’n’ (normal) for standard services, ‘i’ (input) for sensors, ‘o’ (output) for transducers and ‘f’ (filter) for filters; ‘i’ and ‘o’ also supply a port (outPort for ‘i’ and inPort for ‘o’) while ‘f’ supply two ports (inPort and outPort); a port has a corresponding (set of) protocol(s) - it’s TBD if more than one protocol is present, in which case a ‘setProtocol’ request would be needed
