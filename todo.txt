[notation: ‘=‘ universal, ‘+’ service viewer / channel manager, ‘*’ M+M]

= use selected inclusion of ODEnableLogging/ODLogging, ODDisableLogging/ODLogging to bracket code that needs to be logged

+ when copying OGDF files into /usr/local/* from _release, use ‘cp -rp’ so that permissions will allow reading!
[_release/libOGDF.a goes to /usr/local/lib, ogdf/* goes to /usr/local/include]; note that the linker has some issues with OGDF

+ load/save positions, by entity name [optional???]

* change signal handling to use platform-neutral mechanisms

* document the architecture, philosophy and API of the non-viewer code

+ on dragging, do an adjustSize() without repaint?

+ move the ‘update’ code from the scanner thread to the repaint for the content panel; add interlocks like service viewer does - rule #1 is don’t allocate or delete in a different thread, so the repaint does not delete the data collected by the scanner, the scanner builds its entities panel, sets the flags and triggers a repaint of the content panel; the content panel repaint checks if there is new data available, updates if there is and continues on if there isn’t
