[notation: ‘=‘ universal, ‘+’ service viewer / channel manager, ‘*’ M+M, ‘@‘ manual]

= use selected inclusion of ODEnableLogging/ODLogging, ODDisableLogging/ODLogging to bracket code that needs to be logged

+ use the new ‘install’ target for OGDF!
[do a make cleanrelease && make release, make cleandebug && make debug, this will build libOGDF.a in
_release and _debug]

+ for ACE - after building, do a ‘sudo sh’ for installing - and make sure to do ‘export ACE_ROOT=$(pwd)’ and ‘export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=????:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH’ if the install directory is not /usr/local

+ for YARP - unset ACE_ROOT before doing a fresh ‘ccmake ..’, so that the /opt/M+M files will be picked, not the ACE_ROOT ones

* for JavaScript - cd …/gecko/js/src; autoconf213; cd build_OPT.OBJ; ../configure --prefix=/opt/M+M/gecko --with-system-icu; make; sudo make install; sudo cp js/src/js-config.h /opt/M+M/gecko/include/mozjs-37a1 

* change signal handling to use platform-neutral mechanisms

+ on dragging, do an adjustSize() without repaint?

+ if a connection is made outside of the viewer / manager, make sure that a repaint is triggered, not just for a new entity

** javascript should support thread and / or input handler

f) add support for an output-only script - that is, it will be running more-or-less continuously in a thread, generating output

—> use scriptThread to define the behaviour of an output-only thread and add a thread object to the service
—> if scriptThread is defined, don’t look for a value for scriptInlets
—> add scriptHelp, which is invoked (if a function) / displayed (if a string) when ‘?’ is entered after the command prompt
—> add readNumber, readString [skip to next non-blank, collect until next blank, unless ‘ or “, which must be paired], readCharacter [skip to next non-blank, read one character]
