[notation: ‘=‘ universal, ‘+’ service viewer / channel manager, ‘*’ M+M]

= use selected inclusion of ODEnableLogging/ODLogging, ODDisableLogging/ODLogging to bracket code that needs to be logged

+ when copying OGDF files into /usr/local/* from _release, use ‘cp -rp’ so that permissions will allow reading!
[_release/libOGDF.a goes to /usr/local/lib, ogdf/* goes to /usr/local/include]; note that the linker has some issues with OGDF

+ load/save positions, by entity name [optional???]

* change signal handling to use platform-neutral mechanisms

* document the architecture, philosophy and API of the non-viewer code

+ on dragging, do an adjustSize() without repaint?

+ if a connection is made outside of the viewer / manager, make sure that a repaint is triggered, not just for a new entity

[[[ router stuff

Hi Johnty:

Yes, I should be able to change the settings, using the PC tower to access the router. I expect to be in on Monday, and I'll send you an e-mail when I've made the change.

Hi Norm,

Thanks for setting up the VPN. Unfortunately, the QuickVPN configuration you used doesn't seem to work for some reason - I've tried it at a few different locations and with different settings, to no avail. Would you be able to set it according to the instructions originally created, using PPTP instead?

Thanks,

Johnty

Hi Norm,

When you get the chance, could you please connect to the 192.168.102.1 router, and add a PPTP VPN user with the following info:

username: johnty
password: meaning2013

(The instructions are [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A7So_FJli3dTGPXMEOdAzrIwoywQwOv4IHOSVHCcqz4/view#bookmark=id.g5zocdb6mfps] in case you need them)

and also, please confirm that the WAN IP of that router is still 142.58.249.222.

Please let me know when this is active. Thanks!

Johnty
