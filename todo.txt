* the running sum adapter command set should include start / stop / quit / reset

* use selected inclusion of ODEnableLogging/ODLogging, ODDisableLogging/ODLogging to bracket code that needs to be logged

* check RegistryService for instability when ‘probed’

* add ClientList utility, to probe all (or a specific) service(s) for non-transient connections - use the new ‘clients’ request to create a list of non-NULL contexts

* make sure that the RequestCounterService uses contexts for testing the ClientList

* the context map and request map should be protected against multiple simultaneous access

* protect SQLite3 calls as well

* re-enable tracing for RegistryService, to identify _why_ it begins to fail
