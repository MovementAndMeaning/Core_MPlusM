* move responsibility / ownership of request handlers out of request map; service should remember it’s request handlers, unregister them during the destructor and delete them.
* add alternative names for requests - this is why ownership must be with services
* make sure that the requests are given the name they were invoked with
* the running sum service should handle sets of numbers and return the final (running) sum, rather than return intermediate sums
* the running sum client should construct a sequence of numbers to send to the service, rather than sending the numbers one at a time
* the running sum adapter command set should include start / stop / quit / reset
* if a unit test fails, it should tag the log with a special line so that it can be found when logging is enabled
* figure out a way to ‘kill’ the YARP close operation when it hangs
