[notation: ‘=‘ universal, ‘+’ service viewer, ‘*’ M+M]

= use selected inclusion of ODEnableLogging/ODLogging, ODDisableLogging/ODLogging to bracket code that needs to be logged

+ use a double-buffering scheme to refresh the display, with a timer to initiate a fresh scan; if adding or deleting is active, reschedule the scan; protect the entity list with a semaphore so that the switchover from one list of entities to the freshly-scanned list won’t break the display 

+ use ‘yarp clean —timeout 3’ logic for port exploration or send the ‘clean’ command to yarp before scanning

* add ‘sendKeepAlive’ to base service [virtual - Registry Service goes directly to database] to signal to the Registry Service that the sending service is still active; when a service starts, an ‘expected alive arrival time’ is set, and a background thread checks all the ‘expected alive arrival time’ - if it is earlier than the current time, flag the service as inactive; the ‘expected arrival time’ should be a multiple of the background thread scan interval

+ note that selecting an entity after connecting other entities sometimes causes the new entity to jump!

+ need some form of auto-positioning of entities - perhaps OGDF!!!
