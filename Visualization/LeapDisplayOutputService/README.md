Leap Display Output Service
===========================

The m+mLeapDisplayOutputService application displays a single window view of the connections within a YARP network, with features designed to make management of an m+m installation easier. Simple YARP network ports are shown as rectangles with a title consisting of the IP address and port number of the port, and the YARP name for the port as the body of the rectangle, prefixed with ‘In’ for input–only ports, ‘Out’ for output–only ports and ‘I/O’ for general ports.

Note that the m+mLeapDisplayOutputService application requires an m+m installation, and will not execute properly unless there is a 'reachable' YARP server running.
