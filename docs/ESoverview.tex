\primaryStart{Overview}
\textbf{Movement~and~Meaning~Middleware} (also known as \mplusm{}) is a software system
that acts as an intermediary between subsystems that provide sensor data, such as
accelerometers and motion capture cameras, and actuators such as projectors and sound
systems.
It provides mechanisms for reporting and interrogating the protocols used by the sensors
and actuators, as well as a standard architecture for creating services.\\

Two services are provided with \mplusm{} to support developing services using scripting
languages \longDash{} \CL, via the \CLF{} service and \JS, via the \JSF{} service.\\

The \CLF{} service is a derivative of the \mplusm{} class \asCode{m+mBaseFilterService};
it responds to the standard requests required by its parent class and acts as an interface
to a \CL{} file that defines the behaviour of the service.\\

The \CLF{} service is only available for \win{} 32-bit and \mac{} versions of \mplusm.\\

The \JSF{} service is a derivative of the \mplusm{} class \asCode{m+mBaseFilterService};
it responds to the standard requests required by its parent class and acts as an interface
to a \JS{} file that defines the behaviour of the service.\\

The standard behaviour of \asCode{m+mBaseFilterService} class instances is described in
the \emph{\MMM} manual.
