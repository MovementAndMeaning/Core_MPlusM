\primaryStart[ThePDOservice]{The \PDO{} Service}
The \asCode{m+mPlatonicDisplayOutputService} application is an Output service, displaying
the stream of values from a running \asCode{m+mRandomBurstInputService} application.
The application responds to the standard Output service requests and can be used as a
standalone data sink, without the need for a client connection.\\

The \emph{configuration} request has no arguments and returns nothing.\\

The \emph{configure} request has no arguments and does nothing.\\

The \emph{restartStreams} request stops and then starts the input stream.\\

The \emph{startStreams} request initiates displaying 3D images on the display window.
Once started, the service will convert random number triples from the input \yarp{}
network connection into displayed shapes.\\

The \emph{stopStreams} request stops the input \yarp{} network connection.\\ 

Note that the application will exit if the \emph{\RS} is not running.\\

The \asCode{m+mPlatonicDisplayOutputService} application is launched as a standard GUI
application.
When launched, the following dialog will be presented:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchPlatonicDisplayOutputService}%
{launchServicePlatonicDisplay}{Launch options for the \emph{\PDO} service}{0.8}
\condPage{}
Before the service has been started, the following will be displayed:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/platonicDisplayOutputServiceBeforeStart}%
{beforeStartPlatonicDisplay}{Display before the \emph{\PDO} service starts}{0.8}
\condPage{}
The service is started via the Operation menu:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/platonicDisplayOutputServiceOperationMenu}%
{operationMenuPlatonicDisplay}{The Operation menu for the \emph{\PDO} service}{0.8}

After the service has been started, it needs to have it's input stream connected to a
running copy of the\\
\asCode{m+mRandomBurstInputService} application;
once this is done, the display will change to the following:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/runningPlatonicDisplayOutputService}%
{serviceRunningPlatonicDisplay}{Display while the \emph{\PDO} service is running}{0.8}
\condPage{}
The \asCode{m+mPlatonicDisplayOutputService} application window will then convert each
set of three floating-point numbers that it receives into the coordinates of a shape.\\

The display can be rotated or tilted by dragging the mouse within the displayed area;
the View menu can be used to zoom in or out of the images:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/platonicDisplayOutputServiceViewMenu}%
{viewMenuPlatonicDisplay}{The View menu for the \emph{\PDO} service}{0.8}
\primaryEnd{}
