Each time that the Leap Motion controller reports that there is information available,
the \asCode{LeapTwoPalmsInputService} packages it into a single message
\openSq\asCode{Bottle}\closeSq, containing the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A flag value indicating which palm positions are present; the value \asCode{1} if
the left hand is present, the value \asCode{2} if the right hand is present and the value
\asCode{3} if both hands are present
\item\exSp{}The three\longDash{}dimensional coordinates of the palm of the left hand, or
zeroes if the left hand is not detected
\item\exSp{}The three\longDash{}dimensional coordinates of the palm of the right hand, or
zeroes if the right hand is not detected
\item\exSp{}The three\longDash{}dimensional normal for the palm of the left hand, or
zeroes if the left hand is not detected
\item\exSp{}The three\longDash{}dimensional normal for the palm of the right hand, or
zeroes if the right hand is not detected
\item\exSp{}The three\longDash{}dimensional velocity for the palm of the left hand, or
zeroes if the left hand is not detected
\item\exSp{}The three\longDash{}dimensional velocity for the palm of the right hand, or
zeroes if the right hand is not detected
\end{itemize}
