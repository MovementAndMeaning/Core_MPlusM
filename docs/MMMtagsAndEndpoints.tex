When launching a service or adapter, there are four options that can be set:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Endpoint to use} this is the name of a new \yarp{} port to use for the
primary port, instead of the default that is provided by the service or adapter
\item\textbf{Tag modifier} this is a flag that controls whether parts of the IPv4 address
of the primary channel will be used to modify the name of the primary channel of the
service or adapter
\item\exSp\textbf{Network port to use} this is the \textbf{IP} port number to use, rather
than having the system assign a port number
\item\exSp\textbf{Tag for the adapter or service} this is a modifier to be applied to the
name of the primary channel of the service or adapter
\end{itemize}

Specifying the `endpoint', `tag modifier' (`mod') or `tag' options will affect the name of
the service or adapter, as well as the name of the \yarp{} ports created by the service or
adapter.\\

To illustrate, we will show the launching and running of the \emph{Random Burst} input
service.\\

For example, if the `endpoint' field is specified, as in the following dialog:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchServiceSpecifiedEndpoint}%
{launchServiceSpecifiedEndpoint}{Launch option with a specified endpoint}{0.8}
\condPage{}
Clicking on the \textbf{OK} button will cause the following image to appear in the
\emph{\MMMU} window when the service has successfully started:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/runningServiceSpecifiedEndpoint}%
{serviceRunningSpecifiedEndpoint}{The \emph{\MMMU} entity for the service with a specified
endpoint}{1.0}

Note that both the primary channel of the service and all output or regular channels of
the service are changed by specifying the `endpoint' option.
If, instead, the `tag' option is specified, as in the following dialog:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchServiceSpecifiedTag}%
{launchServiceSpecifiedTag}{Launch option with a specified tag}{0.8}
\condPage{}
Clicking on the \textbf{OK} button will cause the following image to appear in the
\emph{\MMMU} window when the service has successfully started:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/runningServiceSpecifiedTag}%
{serviceRunningSpecifiedTag}{The \emph{\MMMU} entity for the service with a specified
tag}{1.0}

Notice that the title bar, and hence the name, of the service or adapter, is changed by
the `tag' option value, and the channels of the service or adapter have the `tag' value
appended.
Lastly, if both the `endpoint' and `tag' options are specified, as in the following
dialog:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchServiceSpecifiedEndpointAndTag}%
{launchServiceSpecifiedEndpointAndTag}{Launch option with a specified endpoint and tag}%
{0.8}
\condPage{}
Clicking on the \textbf{OK} button will cause the following image to appear in the
\emph{\MMMU} window when the service has successfully started:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/runningServiceSpecifiedEndpointAndTag}%
{serviceRunningSpecifiedEndpointAndTag}{The \emph{\MMMU} entity for the service with a
specified endpoint and tag}{1.0}

In this case, the title bar and the name of the service or adapter are modified by the
value of the `tag' option, while the value of the `endpoint' option determines the names
of the \yarp{} channels created by the service or adapter.\\

If the `mod' option is used, the `tag' option is primarily affected.
For example, if the `endpoint' field is specified, along with a tag modifier of 1 byte, as
in the following dialog:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchServiceSpecifiedEndpointM1}%
{launchServiceSpecifiedEndpointM1}%
{Launch option with a specified endpoint and tag modifier}{0.8}

Clicking on the \textbf{OK} button will cause the following image to appear in the
\emph{\MMMU} window when the service has successfully started:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/runningServiceSpecifiedEndpointM1}%
{serviceRunningSpecifiedEndpointM1}{The \emph{\MMMU} entity for the service with a
specified endpoint and one byte tag modifier}{1.0}
\condPage{}
If the tag modifier is 2 bytes, clicking on the \textbf{OK} button will cause the
following image to appear in the \emph{\MMMU} window when the service has successfully
started:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/runningServiceSpecifiedEndpointM2}%
{serviceRunningSpecifiedEndpointM2}{The \emph{\MMMU} entity for the service with a
specified endpoint and two byte tag modifier}{1.0}

If the tag modifier is 3 bytes, clicking on the \textbf{OK} button will cause the
following image to appear in the \emph{\MMMU} window when the service has successfully
started:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/runningServiceSpecifiedEndpointM3}%
{serviceRunningSpecifiedEndpointM3}{The \emph{\MMMU} entity for the service with a
specified endpoint and three byte tag modifier}{1.0}

If the tag modifier is 4 bytes, clicking on the \textbf{OK} button will cause the
following image to appear in the \emph{\MMMU} window when the service has successfully
started:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/runningServiceSpecifiedEndpointM4}%
{serviceRunningSpecifiedEndpointM4}{The \emph{\MMMU} entity for the service with a
specified endpoint and four byte tag modifier}{1.0}
\condPage{}
If, instead, the `tag' option is specified, along with a tag modifier of 1 byte, as in the
following dialog:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchServiceSpecifiedTagM1}%
{launchServiceSpecifiedTagM1}{Launch option with a specified tag and one byte tag
modifier}{0.8}

Clicking on the \textbf{OK} button will cause the following image to appear in the
\emph{\MMMU} window when the service has successfully started:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/runningServiceSpecifiedTagM1}%
{serviceRunningSpecifiedTagM1}{The \emph{\MMMU} entity for the service with a specified
tag and one byte tag modifier}{1.0}
