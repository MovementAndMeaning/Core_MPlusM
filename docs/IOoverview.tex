\primaryStart{Overview}
\textbf{Movement~and~Meaning~Middleware} (also known as \mplusm{}) is a software system
that acts as an intermediary between subsystems that provide sensor data, such as
accelerometers and motion capture cameras, and actuators such as projectors and sound
systems.
It provides mechanisms for reporting and interrogating the protocols used by the sensors
and actuators, as well as a standard architecture for creating services.\\

A number of Input / Output services are provided with \mplusm:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{\KVtwoI} service is a derivative of the \mplusm{} class
\asCode{m+mBaseInputService};
it responds to the standard requests required by its parent class and acts as an interface
to a Kinect V2 controller attached to the computer on which it runs
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\KVtwoBI} service is a variation on the \KVtwoI{} service that
provides a single binary blob containing the data from the Kinect V2 controller
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\LMI} service is a derivative of the \mplusm{} class
\asCode{m+mBaseInputService};
it responds to the standard requests required by its parent class and acts as an interface
to a Leap Motion controller attached to the computer on which it runs
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\LBI} service is a variation on the \LMI{} service that provides a
single binary blob containing the data from the Leap Motion controller
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\LTFI} service is a variation on the \LMI{} service that provides
a simplified data stream from the Leap Motion controller \longDash{} the position of the
first detected finger of the first two detected hands
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\LTPI} service is a variation on the \LMI{} service that provides
a simplified data stream from the Leap Motion controller \longDash{} the position, normal
and velocity of the palm of the first two detected hands
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\LFI}
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\LDO}
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\NNI} service is a derivative of the \mplusm{} class
\asCode{m+mBaseInputService};
it responds to the standard requests required by its parent class and acts as an interface
to a Natural Point NetNet controller attached to the computer on which it runs
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\NNBI} service is a variation on the \NNI{} service that provides
a single binary blob containing the data from the Natural Point NetNet controller
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\PDO}
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\OSI} service is a derivative of the \mplusm{} class
\asCode{m+mBaseInputService};
it responds to the standard requests required by its parent class and acts as an interface
to an Organic Motion OpenStage controller attached to the computer on which it runs
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\OSBI} service is a variation on the \OSI{} service that provides
a single binary blob containing the data from the Organic Motion OpenStage controller
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\PCtwoI} service is a derivative of the \mplusm{} class
\asCode{m+mBaseInputService};
it responds to the standard requests required by its parent class and acts as an interface
to a ProComp2 controller attached to the computer on which it runs
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\SMO} service is a derivative of the \mplusm{} class
\asCode{m+mBaseOutputService};
it responds to the standard requests required by its parent class and acts as an interface
to an ActiveMQ broker
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\VDSI} service is a derivative of the \mplusm{} class
\asCode{m+mBaseInputService};
it responds to the standard requests required by its parent class and acts as an interface
to a Vicon DataStream server
\item\exSp{}The \textbf{\VBI} service is a variation on the \VDSI{} service that provides
a single binary blob containing the data from the Vicon DataStream server
\end{itemize}

The \KVtwoI, \KVtwoBI, \KVtwoSI, \NNI, \NNBI, \VDSI{} and \VBI{} services are only
available for \win{} versions of \mplusm;
the \OSI{} and \OSBI{} services are only available for \win{} 64-bit versions of \mplusm;
the \PCtwoI{} service is only available for \win{} 32-bit versions of \mplusm;
the \SMO{} service is only available for \win{} 64-bit and \mac{} versions of \mplusm.\\

The standard behaviour of \asCode{m+mBaseInputService} and \asCode{m+mBaseOutputService}
class instances is described in the \emph{\MMM} manual.
