\primaryStart{The~Message~Format: \VDSI}
Each time that the Vicon DataStream controller reports that there is information
available, the\\
\asCode{ViconDataStreamInputService} packages it into a single message
\openSq\asCode{Bottle}\closeSq, containing the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A list of subjects
\end{itemize}

For each valid subject, a dictionary \openSq\asCode{Property}\closeSq{} is added to the
list of subjects, with an entry for each non\longDash{}occluded segment reported.\\

Each segment entry consists of the segment name as its key and a value consisting of a
list of floating\longDash{}point numbers, with the three\longDash{}dimensional coordinates
\openSq{}X, Y, Z\closeSq{} of the `translation' of the segment, followed by the rotation
quaternion \openSq{}x, y, z, w\closeSq{} for the segment.
