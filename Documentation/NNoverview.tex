\primaryStart{Overview}
\textbf{Movement~and~Meaning~Middleware} (also known as \mplusm) is a software system
that acts as an intermediary between subsystems that provide sensor data, such as
accelerometers and motion capture cameras, and actuators such as projectors and sound
systems.
It provides mechanisms for reporting and interrogating the protocols used by the sensors
and actuators, as well as a standard architecture for creating services.\\

The \NNI{} service is a derivative of the \mplusm{} class \asCode{m+mBaseInputService};
it responds to the standard requests required by its parent class and acts as an interface
to a Natural Point NetNet controller attached to the computer on which it runs.\\

The \NNBI{} service is a variation on the \NNI{} service that provides a single binary
blob containing the data from the Natural Point NetNet controller.\\

The standard behaviour of \asCode{m+mBaseInputService} class instances is described in
the \emph{\MMM} manual.
