\primaryStart{The~Message~Format: \KVtwoBI}
Each time that the Kinect V2 controller reports that there is information
available, the \asCode{KinectV2BlobInputService} packages it into a single message
\openSq\asCode{Bottle}\closeSq, containing a single binary blob, with the following
format:
\begin{itemize}
\item A line containing the number of subjects to follow
\item\exSp{}A list of subjects, consisting of
\begin{itemize}
\item A line containing the name of the subject and the number of segments
\item\exSp{}A list of segments, with each segment one per line, with its name, the
three\longDash{}dimensional coordinates \openSq{}X, Y, Z\closeSq{} of the `translation'
of the segment, multiplied by the translation scale and the rotation quaternion
\openSq{}x, y, z, w\closeSq{} for the segment
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
