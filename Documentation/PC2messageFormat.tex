\primaryStart{The~Message~Format}
Each time that the ProComp2 controller reports that there is information available,
the \asCode{ProComp2InputService} packages it into a single message
\openSq\asCode{Bottle}\closeSq, containing the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A dictionary \openSq\asCode{Property}\closeSq{} of the sensor values 
\end{itemize}

The dictionary has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{time} \longDash{} the system time at which the sensors were read
\item\exSp\textbf{A} \longDash{} the sensor value for the first encoder port, if
connected
\item\exSp\textbf{B} \longDash{} the sensor value for the second encoder port, if
connected
\item\exSp\textbf{...} \longDash{} sensor values
\end{itemize}
Note that only encoder ports that have sensors attached report their values, so not all
keys (starting with `\textbf{A}') will be reported.
For example, if the only sensor that is connected is in encoder port `\textbf{C}', then
ports `\textbf{A}' and `\textbf{B}' as well as ports with higher numbers than `\textbf{C}'
will not be in the dictionary.
