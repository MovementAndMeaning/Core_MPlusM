The \asCode{mpmNaturalPointInputService} application is an Input service,
generating a stream of information on the position and orientation of one or more bodies.
The application responds to the standard Input service requests and can be used as a
standalone data generator, without the need for a client connection.\\

The \emph{configure} request request has no arguments and does nothing.\\

The \emph{restartStreams} request stops and then starts the output stream.\\

The \emph{startStreams} request request initiates listening to the NaturalPoint
controller.
Once started, the service will send groups of body data via the output \yarp{} network
connection.\\

The \emph{stopStreams} request stops the NaturalPoint controller listener, which stops the
output \yarp{} network connection.\\ 

Note that the application will exit if the \emph{Registry Service} is not running.

If the application is running from a terminal and has not been automatically started via
the `\asCode{go}' option, the following commands are available:
\begin{itemize}
\item\cmdItem{?}{display a list of the available commands}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{b}{start the output stream, sending body data}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{c}{configure the service; this has no effect, as the service has no
configurable parameters}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{e}{stop the output stream}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{q}{quit the application}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{r}{restart the output stream}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{u}{reset the configuration so that it will be reprocessed when the
output stream is restarted}
\end{itemize}

If the service is selected for execution from within the \emph{Channel Manager}
application, the following dialog will be presented:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchProComp2InputService}%
{launchServiceNaturalPoint}{Launch options for the \NPI{} service}{1.0}

For details on the usage of the `endpoint' and `tag' options, see the \emph{Channel
Manager Utility} manual.
Once the options are set, the following image will appear in the \emph{Channel Manager}
window when the service has successfully started:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/runningProComp2InputService}%
{serviceRunningNaturalPoint}{The \emph{Channel Manager} entity for the \NPI{} service}%
