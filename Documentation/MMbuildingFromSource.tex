\appendixStart[BuildingFromSource]{\textitcorr{Building~\mplusm{}~From~Source}}%
An \mplusm{} installation is normally simply installed according to the
\emph{\MMM{}~Installation} manual.
It is also possible to build a customized \mplusm{} from the source files, which can be
done if the \asCode{Developer} package has also been installed.
\secondaryStart{Prerequisites}
\tertiaryStart{General~prerequisites}
At a minimum, the source files from the \asCode{Developer} package must be present on the
system, along with a \compLang{C++} development environment.
Note that the source files are provided as \textbf{ZIP} files that contain a snapshot of
the \asCode{git} repositories where the source code is stored.

\item The \asCode{Packages} GUI tool, from
\companyReference{http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html}{St\'ephane Sudre};
this is only needed if you wish to create installer packages after building \mplusm
\end{itemize}
\tertiaryEnd{}
\tertiaryStart{Prerequisites~for~Microsoft~Windows}
\begin{itemize}
\item \asCode{Visual Studio} is available from Microsoft and provides the \compLang{C++}
development environment for Microsoft Windows; the version used for development is
`\asCode{Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop}', but newer versions should also

\companyReference{http://www.cmake.org/download}{http://www.cmake.org/download}
\item An `\asCode{unzip}' program
\end{itemize}
\tertiaryEnd{}
\secondaryEnd{}
\secondaryStart{Initial~Steps}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a directory to hold the source code; we'll refer to it from now on as
`\asCode{MPM}'
\item Copy the desired \textbf{ZIP} files from their installation location
(\asCode{/opt/M+M/src} on Macintosh OS~X, and \textbf{TBD} for Microsoft Windows) to the
new directory \asCode{MPM}
\item \asCode{unzip} the \textbf{ZIP} files in the directory \asCode{MPM}
\item Remove the \textbf{ZIP} files from the \asCode{MPM} directory
\end{itemize}

\secondaryStart{(Optional)~Building~\textbf{ACE}}
\textbf{ACE} (The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment) provides the low--level networking
support used within \mplusm{}; the files needed to compile and link with ACE are installed
as part of the normal \mplusm{} installation procedure, so it's not necessary to rebuild
ACE; the source code is provided in case there is an issue with the headers or libraries.
\tertiaryStart{Building~on~Macintosh~OS~X}
Note that the file \asCode{ACE\fUS{}wrappers-6.2.6/ace/config.h} will select the correct
configuration file for Macintosh OS~X or Microsoft Windows, so it does not need to be
modified.
\begin{itemize}
\item On the command--line, move to the directory containing the \mplusm{} source code,
\asCode{MPM}
\item Execute the command `\asCode{cd~ACE\fUS{}wrappers2}'
\item Execute the command `\asCode{export~ACE\fUS{}ROOT=\$(pwd)}'
\item Execute the command `\asCode{make~clean~\&\&~make}'; approximate time = 40 minutes
\item If the build is successful, execute the command `\asCode{sudo~sh}'
\item Execute the following commands within the new subshell:
\begin{itemize}
\item \asCode{export~ACE\fUS{}ROOT=\$(pwd)}
\item \asCode{export~DYLD\fUS{}LIBRARY\fUS{}PATH=/opt/M+M/lib:%
\$DYLD\fUS{}LIBRARY\fUS{}PATH}
\item \asCode{make~install}
\item \asCode{exit}
\end{itemize}
\item Execute the command `\asCode{sudo~./after-install.sh}'; this removes some unneeded

\secondaryStart{(Optional)~Building~\textbf{SpiderMonkey}}
\textbf{SpiderMonkey}, is the JavaScript engine used with the JavaScript service or
\mplusm{}; the files needed to compile and link with SpiderMonkey are installed as part of
the normal \mplusm{} installation procedure, so it's not necessary to rebuild
SpiderMonkey.
The source files are not provided with the \asCode{Developer} package, but can be obtained
via the instructions on the web--page
\companyReference{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/%
Getting\_SpiderMonkey\_source\_code}%
{SpiderMonkey source code}, as \mplusm{} does not use a modified version of SpiderMonkey
and does not depend on a particular version -- other than it must be at least SpiderMonkey
\textbf{31}.
\tertiaryStart{Building~on~Macintosh~OS~X}
\begin{itemize}
\item On the command--line, move to the directory containing the SpiderMonkey source code,
which will be named `\asCode{spidermonkey}'
\item Execute the command `\asCode{cd~js/src}'
\item Execute the command `\asCode{autoconf213}'
\item Execute the command `\asCode{mkdir~\fUS{}obj\fUS}'

\item To run the unit tests for \mplusm{}, do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Execute the command `\asCode{ps | grep yarp | grep -v grep}'; if there is a line
similar to `\asCode{30339 ttys004 0:00.01 yarp server\textellipsis}' then the \yarp{}
server is already running
\item If the \yarp{} server is not already running, start a separate terminal session and
launch the \yarp{} server by executing the command `\asCode{yarp~server}'
\item In the terminal session where \mplusm{} was built, execute the command
`\asCode{make~test}'
\item When the test completes, close the new terminal session if one was started for the
test
\end{itemize}
\item To install the freshly--built \mplusm{} files, execute the command
`\asCode{sudo~make~install}'
\item To confirm the normal operation of \mplusm{}, do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Check that the \yarp{} server is running and start it if it is not, using the
instructions above
\item Execute the command `\asCode{mpmRegistryService~\&}'; this will launch the Registry
Service in the background and return the \textbf{PID} that can be used to halt it later
\item Execute the command `\asCode{mpmServiceLister}; this should display the properties
of the Registry Service
\item If you wish to halt the Registry Service, execute the command `\asCode{halt -s HUP}
\#\#\#\#', where ``\#\#\#\#'' is the \textbf{PID} that was returned when the Registry
Service was launched
