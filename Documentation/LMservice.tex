The \asCode{mpmLeapMotionInputService} application is an Input service,
generating a stream of information on the position and orientation of one or more hands.
The application responds to the standard Input service requests and can be used as a
standalone data generator, without the need for a client connection.\\

The \emph{configure} request request has no arguments and does nothing.\\

The \emph{restartStreams} request stops and then starts the output stream.\\

The \emph{startStreams} request request initiates listening to the Leap Motion controller.
Once started, the service will send groups of hand data via the output \yarp{} network
connection.\\

The \emph{stopStreams} request stops the Leap Motion controller listener, which stops the
output \yarp{} network connection.\\ 

Note that the application will exit if the \emph{Registry Service} is not running.\\

The application has five optional parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item\optItem{e}{endpoint}{specifies an alternative endpoint name to be used}
\item\exSp\optItem{h}{help}{display the list of optional parameters and arguments and
leave}
\item\exSp\optItem{p}{port}{specifies the port number to be used, if a
non\longDash{}default port is desired}
\item\exSp\optItem{r}{report}{report the service metrics when the application exits}
\item\exSp\optItem{t}{tag}{specifies the tag to be used as part of the service name}
\end{itemize}
The tag is added to the standard name of the service, so that more than one copy of the
service can execute \longDash{} an \mplusm{} installation can support multiple copies of
each \inputOutput{} service, but the \emph{Channel Manager} application cannot display
them without a distinguishing `tag'.
If the tag is not specified, the standard name of the service will be used.
As well as the service name, the output stream name is modified if a tag is specified and
the default endpoint is being used.\\

If the application is running from a terminal, the following commands are available:
\begin{itemize}
\item\cmdItem{?}{display a list of the available commands}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{b}{start the output stream, sending hand data}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{c}{configure the service; this has no effect, as the service has no
configurable parameters}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{e}{stop the output stream}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{q}{quit the application}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{r}{restart the output stream}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{u}{reset the configuration so that it will be reprocessed when the
output stream is restarted}
\end{itemize}
