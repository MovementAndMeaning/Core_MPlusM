\primaryStart{The~Message~Format}
Each time that the Kinect V2 controller reports that there is information available,
the \asCode{LeapMotionInputService} packages it into a single message
\openSq\asCode{Bottle}\closeSq, containing the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A list of bodies
\end{itemize}

For each valid body, a dictionary \openSq\asCode{Property}\closeSq{} is added to the list
of bodies, with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{lefthand} -- the state of the left hand (`\asCode{closed}', `\asCode{open}',
`\asCode{lasso}' or `\asCode{unknown}' (which should never appear))
\item \textbf{righthand} -- the state of the right hand
\item \textbf{lefthandconfidence} -- the confidence in the state of the left hand
(`\asCode{low}', `\asCode{high}' or `\asCode{unknown}' (which should never appear))
\item \textbf{righthandconfidence} -- the confidence in the state of the right hand
\item \textbf{joints} -- a list of joints
\end{itemize}

The joints list consists of the following joints:\\
\textbraceleft{} \emph{head}, \emph{neck}, \emph{spineshoulder}, \emph{spinemid},
\emph{spinebase}, \emph{shoulderright}, \emph{shoulderleft}, \emph{hipright},
\emph{hipleft}, \emph{elbowright}, \emph{wristright},\\
\emph{handright}, \emph{handtipright}, \emph{thumbright}, \emph{elbowleft},
\emph{wristleft}, \emph{handleft}, \emph{handtipleft}, \emph{thumbleft}, \emph{kneeright},
\emph{ankleright},\\
\emph{footright}, \emph{kneeleft}, \emph{ankleleft}, \emph{footleft} \textbraceright\\

Not all joints will be present in each message.\\

For each ``tracked'' joint, a dictionary is added to the joints list, with the following
properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{tag} -- the name of the bone, as listed above
\item \textbf{position} -- the three--dimensional coordinates \openSq{}X, Y,
Z\closeSq{} of the position of the joint, as a list of three floating--point
numbers; the units are most likely metres from the Kinect V2 controller
\item \textbf{orientation} -- the four--dimensional coordinates \openSq{}x, y,
z, w\closeSq{} of the orientation of the joint, as a list of four floating--point
numbers
\end{itemize}
