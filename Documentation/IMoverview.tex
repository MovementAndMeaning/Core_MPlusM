\primaryStart{Overview}
\textbf{Movement~and~Meaning~Middleware} (also known as \mplusm{}) is a software system
that acts as an intermediary between subsystems that provide sensor data, such as
accelerometers and motion capture cameras, and actuators such as projectors and sound
systems.
It provides mechanisms for reporting and interrogating the protocols used by the sensors
and actuators, as well as a standard architecture for creating services.\\

This document describes the installation procedure for \mplusm{}, for both end--users and
developers.
For Macintosh OS X, all the elements of \mplusm{} are placed in the directories
\asCode{/opt/M+M} and \asCode{/Applications}.\\

Some familiarity with the \asCode{Terminal} application (found in the
\asCode{/Applications/Utilities} folder) is required in order to test the installation
procedure.
