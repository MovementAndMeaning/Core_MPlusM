\appendixStart{\textitcorr{Examples}}
The examples that are part of the \mplusm{} set of source files are provided to support
the development of custom applications.
There are example clients, services, adapters as well as examples of the more specialized
Input, Output and Filter services.\\

All the example applications respond to a `HUP' signal and will exit gracefully when one
is sent to them.
\secondaryStart{Example~Services}
The set of example services include a pair of simple services
[\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mEchoService} and
\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mRandomNumberService}], a service with client context
[\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mRunningSumService}] as well as an input service
[\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mRandomBurstInputService}], three output services
[\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mAbsorberOutputService},
\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mRecordAsJSONOutputService} and\\
\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mRecordIntegersOutputService}] and a filter service
[\examplesNameR{Services}{m+mTruncateFloatFilterService}].\\

Note that services normally have no direct interface.
That is, they are `faceless' applications and perform their operations without user
interaction.
\tertiaryStart{\examplesNameP{Services}{m+mAbsorberOutputService}}
The \examplesNameX{Services}{m+mAbsorberOutputService} application is an Output
service, accepting (and ignoring) any input data.
The application responds to the standard Output service requests and can be used as a
standalone data sink, without the need for a client connection.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{configure} request has no arguments and
does nothing.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{restartStreams} request stops and then
starts the input stream.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{startStreams} request initiates listening
on the input stream.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{stopStreams} request terminates listening
on the input stream.\\

Note that the application will exit if the \serviceNameR[\RS]{RegistryService} is not
running.\\

The \examplesNameX{Services}{m+mRandomBurstInputService} application is an Input service,
generating a stream of random floating\longDash{}point values, with a given `burst size'
\longDash{} the number of values sent in a group, and a `burst period' \longDash{} the
number of seconds between groups.
The application responds to the standard Input service requests and can be used as a
standalone data generator, without the need for a client connection.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{configure} request has two arguments
\longDash{} a floating\longDash{}point value for the `burst period' and an integer value
for the `burst size'.
These values will be applied when the random number generator is started or restarted.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{restartStreams} request stops and then
starts the random number generator, which restarts the output \yarp{} network
connection.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{startStreams} request starts a random
number generator for the output stream, using the configured `burst period' and
`burst size'.
Once started, the random number generator will send groups of random
floating\longDash{}point values via the output \yarp{} network connection.\\

The \requestsNameR{\inputOutput}{InputOutput}{stopStreams} request stops the random
number generator, which stops the output \yarp{} network connection.\\ 

Note that the application will exit if the \serviceNameR[\RS]{RegistryService} is not
running.\\

The application has two optional arguments \longDash{} the burst period, in seconds and
the number of random values to generate in each burst.
\insertAppParameters
\insertTagDescription{Random Burst Input}

The other parameters provide the initial burst period and size; if not specified, a burst
