Selecting the \textbf{Launch others \textellipsis} menu item will display a menu of
available applications:

\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/appListMenu}{appListMenu}%
{Typical list of available applications}{0.9}
\condPage{}
Selecting an entry for a service in the list will display a dialog box similar to the
following (shown for the Random Burst input service):
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchRandomBurstInputService}{launchService}%
{Launching a regular service}{0.8}

For details on the usage of the `endpoint' and `tag' options, see the 
\appendixRef{TagsAndEndpoints}{What are tags and endpoints} appendix.
Clicking the \textbf{Cancel} button will close the dialog box, while clicking on the
\textbf{Yes} button will launch the service with the given arguments \longDash{} the
particular arguments that will be presented will depend on the service that was selected
from the menu of available applications.

\secondaryStart[StartingRegistryService]{Starting the \emph{\RS}}
Selecting the \textbf{Launch Registry} menu item will result in the following being
displayed:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchRegistryService}{launchRegistryServiceOne}%
{Launching the \emph{\RS}}{0.8}

Note that only valid network ports can be entered, and it is usually not necessary to use
a non-default port; clicking on the \textbf{Cancel} button will exit the dialog box, with
no \emph{\RS} launched, while clicking on the \textbf{OK} button will start a new
\emph{\RS} in the background, that will be stopped when the \emph{\MMMU} application
exits.

\secondaryStart[StartingAdapters]{Starting adapters}
Adapters require that a companion service be running, in order to establish a connection
to the service.
If an adapter is selected from the menu of available applications, and the corresponding
service is not running, an alert box similar to the following will be displayed:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchAdapterWithoutService}{launchAdapterWithoutService}%
{Launching an adapter without its matching service running}{0.95}
\condPage{}
If the corresponding service is running, a dialog box similar to the following will be
displayed (the example being for the Random Number adapter):
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchRandomNumberAdapter}{launchAdapterWithService}%
{Launching an adapter with its matching service running}{0.8}

For details on the usage of the `endpoint' and `tag' options, see the 
\appendixRef{TagsAndEndpoints}{What are tags and endpoints} appendix.
Clicking the \textbf{Cancel} button will close the dialog box, while clicking on the
\textbf{Yes} button will launch the adapter with the given arguments \longDash{} the
particular arguments that will be presented will depend on the adapter that was selected
from the menu of available applications.

\secondaryStart[StoppingRegularServices]{Stopping regular services}
If the \textbf{Stop the service} menu item is chosen when a regular service is selected
\longDash{} a service other than the \emph{\RS} \longDash{} the following will be
displayed:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/stopService}{stopService}{Stopping a regular service}{0.9}

Clicking the \textbf{Cancel} button will close the dialog box without affecting the
selected service, while clicking on the \textbf{Yes} button will stop the selected
application, which can be restarted via the \textbf{Launch others \textellipsis} menu
items, as described in \secondaryRef{StartingRegularServices}{Starting regular services}.
Note that stopping a service that is being used by an adapter may cause the adapter to
crash or behave erratically.
\secondaryEnd
\secondaryStart[StoppingAdapters]{Stopping adapters}
If the \textbf{Stop the adapter} menu item is chosen when an adapter is selected, the
following will be displayed:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/stopAdapter}{stopAdapter}{Stopping an adapter}{0.9}\\

Clicking the \textbf{Cancel} button will close the dialog box without affecting the
selected adapter, while clicking on the \textbf{Yes} button will stop the selected
application, which can be restarted via the \textbf{Launch others \textellipsis} menu
items, as described in \secondaryRef{StartingAdapters}{Starting adapters}.
\secondaryEnd
\secondaryStart[StoppingRegistryService]{Stopping the \emph{\RS}}
If the \textbf{Stop the service} menu item is chosen when the \emph{\RS} is the selected
entity, the following will be displayed:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/stopRegistryService}{stopRegistryService}{Stopping the
\emph{\RS}}{0.8}

Clicking the \textbf{Cancel} button will close the dialog box without affecting the
\emph{\RS}, while clicking on the \textbf{Yes} button will stop the service, which can be
restarted via the \textbf{Launch Registry} menu items, as described in
\secondaryRef{StartingRegistryService}{Starting the \emph{\RS}}.
