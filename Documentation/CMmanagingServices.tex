\secondaryStart[StartingRegularServices]{Starting regular services}
Selecting the \textbf{Launch others \textellipsis} menu item will display a menu of
available applications:

\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/appListMenu}{appListMenu}%
{Typical list of available applications}{1.0}
\clearpage
Selecting an entry in the list will display a dialog box similar to the following (shown
for the Random Burst input service):
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchService}{launchService}%
{Launching a regular service}{1.0}

Clicking the \textbf{Cancel} button will close the dialog box, while clicking on the
\textbf{Yes} button will launch the service with the given arguments \longDash{} the
particular arguments that will be presented will depend on the service that was selected
from the menu of available applications.
\secondaryEnd{}
\clearpage
\secondaryStart[StartingRegistryService]{Starting the \emph{Registry Service}}
Selecting the \textbf{Launch Registry} menu item will result in the following being
displayed:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchRegistryService}{launchRegistryService}%
{Launching the \emph{Registry Service}}{1.0}

Note that only valid network ports can be entered, and it is usually not necessary to use
a non-default port; clicking on the \textbf{Cancel} button will exit the dialog box, with
no \emph{Registry Service} launched, while clicking on the \textbf{OK} will start a new
\emph{Registry Service} in the background, that will be stopped when the
\emph{Channel Manager} application exits.
\secondaryEnd{}
\secondaryStart[StartingAdapters]{Starting adapters}
Adapters require that a companion service be running, in order to establish a connection
to the service.
If an adapter is selected from the menu of available applications, and the corresponding
service is not running, an alert box similar to the following will be displayed:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchAdapterWithoutService}{launchAdapterWithoutService}%
{Launching an adapter without its matching service running}{0.95}
\clearpage
If the corresponding service is running, a dialog box similar to the following will be
displayed (the example being for the Random Number adapter):
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchAdapterWithService}{launchAdapterWithService}%
{Launching an adapter with its matching service running}{1.0}

Clicking the \textbf{Cancel} button will close the dialog box, while clicking on the
\textbf{Yes} button will launch the adapter with the given arguments \longDash{} the
particular arguments that will be presented will depend on the adapter that was selected
from the menu of available applications.
\secondaryEnd{}
\secondaryStart[StoppingRegularServices]{Stopping regular services and adapters}
If the \textbf{Stop the service} menu item is chosen when a regular service or adapter
entity is selected \longDash{} an entity other than the \emph{Registry Service}
\longDash{} the following will be displayed:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/stopService}{stopService}%
{Stopping a regular service}{0.9}
\clearpage
Clicking the \textbf{Cancel} button will close the dialog box without affecting the
selected service or adapter, while clicking on the \textbf{Yes} button will stop the
selected application, which can be restarted via the \textbf{Launch others \textellipsis}
menu items, as described in
\secondaryRef{StartingRegularServices}{Starting regular services} and
\secondaryRef{StartingAdapters}{Starting adapters}.
Note that stopping a service that is being used by an adapter may cause the adapter to
crash or behave erratically.
\secondaryEnd{}
\secondaryStart[StoppingRegistryService]{Stopping the \emph{Registry Service}}
If the \textbf{Stop the service} menu item is chosen when the \emph{Registry Service} is
the selected entity, the following will be displayed:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/stopRegistryService}{stopRegistryService}%
{Stopping the \emph{Registry Service}}{0.8}

Clicking the \textbf{Cancel} button will close the dialog box without affecting the
\emph{Registry Service}, while clicking on the \textbf{Yes} button will stop the service,
which can be restarted via the \textbf{Launch Registry} menu items, as described in
\secondaryRef{StartingRegistryService}{Starting the \emph{Registry Service}}.
