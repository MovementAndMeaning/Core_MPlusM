\primaryStart{The~JavaScript~File~Format}
The \JSF{} service loads a \JS{} file that contains a number of required and optional
values.
Once loaded, the \JS{} functions and values are used to define the behaviour of the
service itself.
\secondaryStart{The~JavaScript~Standard~Classes}
The \JSF{} service provides the following standard classes as part of the \JS{}
environment:\\
\asCode{Array}, \asCode{Boolean}, \asCode{Date}, \asCode{decodeURI},
\asCode{decodeURIComponent}, \asCode{encodeURI}, \asCode{encodeURIComponent},
\asCode{Error}, \asCode{eval}, \asCode{EvalError}, \asCode{Function}, \asCode{Infinity},
\asCode{isNaN}, \asCode{isFinite}, \asCode{Math}, \asCode{NaN}, \asCode{Number},
\asCode{Object}, \asCode{parseInt}, \asCode{parseFloat}, \asCode{RangeError},
\asCode{ReferenceError}, \asCode{RegExp}, \asCode{String}, \asCode{SyntaxError},
\asCode{TypeError}, \asCode{undefined} and \asCode{URIError}.
\secondaryEnd
\secondaryStart{Service~Provided~Classes}
The \JSF{} service provides the following class as part of the \JS{} environment:
\tertiaryStart{Stream}
Objects of the \asCode{Stream} class encapsulate access to standard text files on the
system.
They have the following function properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{\asCode{atEof}()} \longDash{} returns \asCode{true} if the file is at
end\longDash{}of\longDash{}file
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{clearError}()} \longDash{} clears the
end\longDash{}of\longDash{}file and error flags
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{close}()} \longDash{} disconnects from the external file
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{hasError}()} \longDash{} returns \asCode{true} if the error flag
was set by a previous operation
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{isOpen}()} \longDash{} returns \asCode{true} if there is an
external file connected
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{open}(\textit{fn}, \textit{fm})} \longDash{} connects to an
external file at path `\textit{fn}' with mode `\textit{fm}' \openSq{}mode can be
\asCode{"r"}, \asCode{"w"}, et cetera\closeSq
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{readCharacter}()} \longDash{} returns a string containing the
next non\longDash{}blank character from the external file
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{readLine}()} \longDash{} returns a string containing the next
line from the external file
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{readNumber}()} \longDash{} returns the next numeric value from
the external file, or zero; note that end\longDash{}of\longDash{}file or error will be set
if the number could not be read
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{readString}()} \longDash{} returns a string from the external
file; if the string starts with \asCode{"} or \asCode{'}, it ends with the same character
while, otherwise, it starts with the next non\longDash{}blank character and ends when a
blank is read
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{rewind}()} \longDash{} moves back to the beginning of the
external file
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{write}(\textellipsis)} \longDash{} writes the arguments, as
strings, to the external file
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{writeLine}(\textellipsis)} \longDash{} writes the arguments, as
strings, to the external file and adds a newline
\end{itemize}
A \asCode{Stream} object can only be used between calls to its \asCode{open}() and
\asCode{close}() functions; if reading a file and \asCode{atEof}() returns \asCode{true},
no further reading will succeed.
if \asCode{hasError}() returns true, operations other than \asCode{close}() will fail
until \asCode{clearError}() is called.

\secondaryStart{Service~Provided~Functions}
The \JSF{} service provides the following functions as part of the \JS{} environment:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{\asCode{dumpObjectToStdout}(\textit{obj})} \longDash{} writes out the object
`\textit{obj}' to the standard output, including its properties
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{requestStop}()} \longDash{} signals that the service is to stop
at the first opportunity
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{sendToChannel}(\textit{n}, \textit{x})} \longDash{} converts the
value `\textit{x}' to \yarp{} format and sends it to the channel numbered `\textit{n}',
with zero being the first outlet channel
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{writeLineToStdout}(\textit{x})} \longDash{} writes the string
`\textit{x}' to the standard output
\end{itemize}
\secondaryEnd
\secondaryStart{Service~Provided~Values}
The \JSF{} service provides the following values as part of the \JS{} environment:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{\asCode{argv}\openSq\closeSq} \longDash{} a list of the arguments passed
to the script
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{tag}} \longDash{} the (optional) tag argument for the service
script
\end{itemize}
\secondaryEnd
\secondaryStart{The~Required~Values}
The \JSF{} service requires that the following values are supplied by the \JS{} file:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{\asCode{scriptDescription}} \longDash{} a variable or a function that
provides a string describing the script; if defined as a function, it takes no arguments
\end{itemize}
\secondaryEnd
\secondaryStart{The~Optional~Values}
The \JSF{} service will use the following values, if they are supplied by the \JS{} file:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{\asCode{scriptHelp}} \longDash{} a variable or a function that provides a
string that can be presented to the user when requested by the `\asCode{?}' command; note
that it should not end with a newline; if defined as a function it takes no argument
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{scriptInlets}} \longDash{} a variable or a function that
provides an array of inlet descriptions \openSq\asCode{name}, \asCode{protocol},
\asCode{protocolDescription}, \asCode{handler}\closeSq; note that this is ignored if
\asCode{scriptThread}() is defined
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{scriptInterval}} \longDash{} a variable or a function that
provides the interval between executions of the \asCode{scriptThread}() function; note
that this is ignored if \asCode{scriptThread}() is not defined, and it is executed only
once, after all the other values have been processed
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{scriptOutlets}} \longDash{} a variable or a function that
provides an array of outlet descriptions \openSq\asCode{name}, \asCode{protocol},
\asCode{protocolDescription}\closeSq
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{scriptStarting}()} \longDash{} a function that is called before
any inlets are attached or threads started
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{scriptStopping}()} \longDash{} a function that is called after
all the inlets are detached and threads are stopped
\item\exSp\textbf{\asCode{scriptThread}()} \longDash{} a function that is repeatedly
called by the output thread of the service
\end{itemize}

\secondaryStart{The~Execution~Sequence}
The following sequence of actions occur when a \JS{} file is loaded and run:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \JS{} environment is set up
\item\exSp{}The \JS{} file is read from disk and any global statements are executed
\item\exSp{}The \asCode{scriptDescription} value is retrieved (or the
\asCode{scriptDescription}() function is executed to get a value)
\item\exSp{}The \asCode{scriptHelp} value is retrieved, if it is present
\item\exSp{}The \asCode{scriptThread}() function is located, if present
\item\exSp{}If there was no \asCode{scriptThread}() function defined, the
\asCode{scriptInlets} value is retrieved (or the\\
\asCode{scriptInlets}() function is executed to get a value)
\item\exSp{}The \asCode{scriptOutlets} value is retrieved (or the
\asCode{scriptOutlets}() function is executed to get a value)
\item\exSp{}The \asCode{scriptStarting}() function is located, if present
\item\exSp{}The \asCode{scriptStopping}() function is located, if present
\item\exSp{}If there was a \asCode{scriptThread}() function defined, the
\asCode{scriptInterval} value is retrieved (or the\\
\asCode{scriptInterval}() function is executed to get a value)
\item\exSp{}The required inlets and outlets are created
\item\exSp{}The service is started
\begin{itemize}
\item If the \asCode{scriptStarting}() function was defined, it is executed
\item\exSp{}If the \asCode{scriptThread}() function was defined, a thread is created and
given the \asCode{scriptThread}() function to be executed
\item\exSp{}If the \asCode{scriptThread}() function was not defined, input handlers are
created for each inlet and given the \asCode{handler}() function from their inlet
description
\end{itemize}
\item\exSp{}The service is stopped
\begin{itemize}
\item If the \asCode{scriptThread}() function was defined, the thread is stopped and
destroyed
\item\exSp{}If the \asCode{scriptThread}() function was not defined, the input handlers
for each inlet are deactivated
\item\exSp{}If the \asCode{scriptStopping}() function was defined, it is executed
