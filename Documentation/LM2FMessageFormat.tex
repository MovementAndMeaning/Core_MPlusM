Each time that the Leap Motion controller reports that there is information available,
the \asCode{LeapTwoFingersInputService} packages it into a single message
\openSq\asCode{Bottle}\closeSq, containing the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A flag value indicating which finger positions are present; the value \asCode{1} if
the left hand is present, the value \asCode{2} if the right hand is present and the value
\asCode{3} if both hands are present
\item\exSp{}The three\longDash{}dimensional coordinates of the tip of the first detected
finger of the left hand, or zeroes if the left hand is not detected
\item\exSp{}The three\longDash{}dimensional coordinates of the tip of the first detected
finger of the right hand, or zeroes if the right hand is not detected
\end{itemize}
