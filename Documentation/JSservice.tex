The \asCode{mpmJavaScriptService} application is an \inputOutput{} service,
executing a set of \JS{} functions contained in a file.
The application responds to the standard \inputOutput{} service requests and can be used
as a standalone data generator, without the need for a client connection.\\

The \emph{configure} request request has no arguments and does nothing.\\

The \emph{restartStreams} request stops and then starts processing thread and the input
and output streams.\\

The \emph{startStreams} request starts a processing thread and the input and output
streams.
Once started, the processing thread will execute the \asCode{scriptThread} function with
an interval provided by the value of \asCode{scriptInterval}.\\

The \emph{stopStreams} request stops the processing thread and the input and output
streams.\\ 

Note that the application will exit if the \emph{Registry Service} is not running.\\

The application has one argument \longDash{} the path to the \JS{} file to be used.
Any additional arguments are passed to the \JS{} environment.

\item\cmdItem{?}{display a list of the available commands and any help text provided in
the \asCode{scriptHelp} value}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{b}{start the processing thread and the input and output streams}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{c}{configure the service; this has no effect, as the service has no
configurable parameters}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{e}{stop the processing thread and input and output streams}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{q}{quit the application}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{r}{restart the processing thread and input and output streams}
\item\exSp\cmdItem{u}{reset the configuration so that it will be reprocessed when the
