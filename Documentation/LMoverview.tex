\primaryStart{Overview}
\textbf{Movement~and~Meaning~Middleware} (also known as \mplusm) is a software system
that acts as an intermediary between subsystems that provide sensor data, such as
accelerometers and motion capture cameras, and actuators such as projectors and sound
systems.
It provides mechanisms for reporting and interrogating the protocols used by the sensors
and actuators, as well as a standard architecture for creating services.\\

The \LMI{} service is a derivative of the \mplusm{} class \asCode{mpmBaseInputService};
it responds to the standard requests required by its parent class and acts as an interface
to a Leap Motion controller attached to the computer on which it runs.\\

The \TFI{} service is a variation on the \LMI{} service that provides a simplified data
stream from the Leap Motion controller -- the position of the first detected finger of
the first two detected hands.\\

The standard behaviour of \asCode{mpmBaseInputService} class instances is described in
the \emph{\MMM} manual.
