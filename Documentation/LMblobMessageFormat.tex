\primaryStart{The~Message~Format: \LBI}
Each time that the Leap Motion controller reports that there is information available,
the \asCode{LeapBlobInputService} packages it into a single message
\openSq\asCode{Bottle}\closeSq, containing a single binary blob, with the following
format:
\begin{itemize}
\item A line containing the number of hands to follow
\item\exSp{}A list of hands, consisting of
\begin{itemize}
\item A line containing the name of the hand (`\asCode{left}', `\asCode{right}' or
`\asCode{unknown}' (which should never appear)) and the number of fingers
\item\exSp{}A list of fingers, with each finger one per line, with its name
(`\asCode{thumb}', `\asCode{index}', `\asCode{middle}', `\asCode{ring}', `\asCode{pinky}'
or `\asCode{unknown}' (which should never appear)), the three\longDash{}dimensional
coordinates of the tip of the finger, multiplied by the translation scale and the
direction in which the finger tip is pointing, as a quaternion
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
