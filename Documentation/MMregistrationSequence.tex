\appendixStart[RegistrationSequence]{\textitcorr{Registration~Sequence}}

A \requestsNameR{\RS}{RegistryService}{register} or
\requestsNameR{\RS}{RegistryService}{ping} request sent to the
\serviceNameR[\RS]{RegistryService} triggers the following sequence of
requests to the service that sent the original request \longDash{}
\begin{enumerate}
\item\textbf{\requestsNameR{Basic}{Basic}{name}} collect basic information about the
service
\item\textbf{\requestsNameR{Basic}{Basic}{list}} gather information about the requests
available from the service
\end{enumerate}
The \serviceNameR[\RS]{RegistryService} plays the r\^ole of a client of the service that
sent the original \requestsNameR{\RS}{RegistryService}{register} or
\requestsNameR{\RS}{RegistryService}{ping} request, in order to obtain the information
required to manage its internal database, which is described in the
\appendixRef{InternalDatabaseStructure}{Internal~Database~Structure} appendix.\\

The \requestsNameR{Basic}{Basic}{name} request is used to populate the `Services' table
and the \requestsNameR{Basic}{Basic}{list} request is used to populate the `Requests',
`Keywords' and `RequestsKeywords' tables.\\

Note that a \requestsNameR{\RS}{RegistryService}{ping} request will not send
\requestsNameR{Basic}{Basic}{name} or \requestsNameR{Basic}{Basic}{list} to the
\serviceNameR[\RS]{RegistryService} if the requesting service is recognized as being
registered already.
As a consequence, services are not allowed to make changes that would impact their
connectivity after they are registered.\\

In particular, the names of \yarp{} network connections, supported requests (or their
descriptions) or the kind or name of a service cannot be changed after the service
registers.
If such a change is necessary, the service should be unregistered and then registered, so
that the internal database is consistent with the active services.\\

Note that unregistering a service does not break connections between the service and its
clients, so it may also be necessary to have the service drop its connections as well.
