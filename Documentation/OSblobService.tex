The \asCode{m+mOpenStageBlobInputService} application is an Input service,
generating a stream of information on the position and orientation of one or more bodies.
The application responds to the standard Input service requests and can be used as a
standalone data generator, without the need for a client connection.\\

The \emph{configuration} request has no arguments and returns floating\longDash{}point
value for the translation scale to apply to the joint coordinates, the string value for
the host name of the Organic Motion OpenStage controller and the integer value for the
port on the Organic Motion OpenStage controller to connect to.\\

The \emph{configure} request has three arguments \longDash{} a floating\longDash{}point
value for the translation scale to apply to the joint coordinates, a string value for
the host name of the Organic Motion OpenStage controller and an integer value for the port
on the Organic Motion OpenStage controller to connect to.
These values will be applied when the output stream is started or restarted.\\ 

The \emph{restartStreams} request stops and then starts the output stream.\\

The \emph{startStreams} request request initiates listening to the Organic Motion
OpenStage controller.
Once started, the service will send groups of body data via the output \yarp{} network
connection.\\

The \emph{stopStreams} request stops the Organic Motion OpenStage controller listener,
which stops the output \yarp{} network connection.\\ 

Note that the application will exit if the \emph{\RS} is not running.
\secondaryStart[StartingFromCommandLine]{Starting from the command\longDash{}line}
The application has three optional arguments \longDash{} the translation scale to be
applied to the coordinates and the host name and port for the Organic Motion OpenStage
controller.
