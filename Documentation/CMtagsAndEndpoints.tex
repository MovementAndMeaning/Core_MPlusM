\appendixStart[TagsAndEndpoints]{\textitcorr{What are tags and endpoints}}
When launching a service or adapter, there are three options that can be set:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Endpoint to use} this is the name of a new \yarp{} port to use for the
primary port, instead of the default that is provided by the service or adapter
\item\exSp\textbf{Network port to use} this is the \textbf{IP} port number to use, rather
than having the system assign a port number
\item\exSp\textbf{Tag for the adapter or service} this is a modifier to be applied to the
name of the primary channel of the service or adapter
\end{itemize}

Specifying either or both of the `endpoint' or `tag' options will affect the name of the
service or adapter, as well as the name of the \yarp{} ports created by the service or
adapter.\\

To illustrate, we will show the launching and running of the \emph{Random Burst} input
service.\\

For example, if the `endpoint' field is specified, as in the following dialog:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchServiceSpecifiedEndpoint}%
{launchServiceSpecifiedEndpoint}{Launch option with a specified endpoint}{0.8}
\condPage{}
Clicking on the \textbf{OK} button will cause the following image to appear in the
\emph{\CMU} window when the service has successfully started:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/runningServiceSpecifiedEndpoint}%
{serviceRunningSpecifiedEndpoint}{The \emph{\CMU} entity for the service with a specified
endpoint}{1.0}

Note that both the primary channel of the service and all output or regular channels of
the service are changed by specifying the `endpoint' option.
If, instead, the `tag' option is specified, as in the following dialog:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchServiceSpecifiedTag}%
{launchServiceSpecifiedTag}{Launch option with a specified tag}{0.8}
\condPage{}
Clicking on the \textbf{OK} button will cause the following image to appear in the
\emph{\CMU} window when the service has successfully started:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/runningServiceSpecifiedTag}%
{serviceRunningSpecifiedTag}{The \emph{\CMU} entity for the service with a specified
tag}{1.0}

Notice that the title bar, and hence the name, of the service or adapter, is changed by
the `tag' option value, and the channels of the service or adapter have the `tag' value
appended.
Lastly, if both the `endpoint' and `tag' options are specified, as in the following
dialog:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/launchServiceSpecifiedEndpointAndTag}%
{launchServiceSpecifiedEndpointAndTag}{Launch option with a specified endpoint and tag}%
{0.8}
\condPage{}
Clicking on the \textbf{OK} button will cause the following image to appear in the
\emph{\CMU} window when the service has successfully started:
\objScaledDiagram{mpm_images/runningServiceSpecifiedEndpointAndTag}%
{serviceRunningSpecifiedEndpointAndTag}{The \emph{\CMU} entity for the service with a
specified endpoint and tag}{1.0}

In this case, the title bar and the name of the service or adapter are modified by the
value of the `tag' option, while the value of the `endpoint' option determines the names
of the \yarp{} channels created by the service or adapter.
