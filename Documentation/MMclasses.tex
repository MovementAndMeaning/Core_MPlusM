\primaryStart[ClassesAndTheirInterfaces]{Classes~and~Their~Interfaces}
The \mplusm{} classes are organized into seven namespaces:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\mplusm{}::Common} classes that support all the \mplusm{} activities
\item \textbf{\mplusm{}::Example} classes that demonstrate features of \mplusm{}
\item \textbf{\mplusm{}::Parser} classes that are used by the
\requestsNameR{Service~Registry}{ServiceRegistry}{match} request of the
\serviceNameR[Service~Registry]{ServiceRegistry}
\item \textbf{\mplusm{}::Registry} classes that work with the internal database to manage
the \mplusm{} services
\item \textbf{\mplusm{}::RequestCounter} classes that support measuring the performance
of an \mplusm{} installation
\item \textbf{\mplusm{}::Test} classes that are used during unit--testing of the \mplusm{}
source code
\item \textbf{\mplusm{}::Utilities} classes that are used only with the \mplusm{}
utility programs
\end{itemize}
There are 38 classes or structures in the \textbf{\mplusm{}::Common} namespace, 27 in
\textbf{\mplusm{}::Example}, 8 in \textbf{\mplusm{}::Parser}, 14 in
\textbf{\mplusm{}::Registry}, 6 in \textbf{\mplusm{}::RequestCounter}, 20 in
\textbf{\mplusm{}::Test} and 3 in \textbf{\mplusm{}::Utilities}.
The following sections describe the most critical of the classes in the
\textbf{\mplusm{}::Common} namespace -- many of the other classes, in all the namespaces,
derive from these classes. 
\secondaryStart{BaseAdapterData}
The class \secondaryRef{BaseAdapterData}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseAdapterData}} is used to
provide common methods and variables for data that is shared between instances of
derived classes of \secondaryRef{BaseService}{BaseService} and instances of derived
classes of \classNameP{Common}{BaseInputHandler}.
In particular, the shared data includes the activation state of the input stream and the
primary output stream to use when responding to input data.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseAdapterData}}
\secondaryStart{BaseClient}
Instances of derived classes of \secondaryRef{BaseClient}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseClient}}
are responsible for mediating \mplusm{} communication with corresponding instances of
derived classes of \secondaryRef{BaseService}{BaseService}.\\

The bulk of the mechanisms needed to perform this are provided by the
\secondaryRef{BaseClient}{BaseClient} class itself, and the derived classes need only
provide service--specific routines, such as \asCode{getOneRandomNumber()},
which is a method of the \asCode{M+M::Example::RandomNumberClient} class.\\

The following methods are available to code that uses
\secondaryRef{BaseClient}{BaseClient} classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\asCode{FindMatchingService}} This static function is provided for the use
of utility programs that need to identify active services
\item \textbf{\asCode{addAssociatedChannel}} Adapter applications use this method to
inform the \serviceNameR[Service~Registry]{ServiceRegistry} about their input and output
\yarp{} network connections
\item \textbf{\asCode{connectToService}} This method is use by clients to establish a
connection to the endpoint of their companion service
\item \textbf{\asCode{disconnectFromService}} This method is used by clients to release
the connection to their companion service
\item \textbf{\asCode{findService}} This method is used by clients to locate the channel
to be used for communication with their companion service
\item \textbf{\asCode{reconnectIfDisconnected}} This method is used by clients to
re--establish a dropped connection with their companion service
\item \textbf{\asCode{removeAssociatedChannels}} Adapter applications use this method to
inform the \serviceNameR[Service~Registry]{ServiceRegistry} that their input and output
\yarp{} network connections are no longer available
\item \textbf{\asCode{send}} This method is used by clients to send a request to their
companion service
\end{itemize}
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseClient}}
\secondaryStart{BaseContext}
Instances of derived classes of \secondaryRef{BaseService}{BaseService} that have \yarp{}
network connections with persistent state use instances of
derived classes of \secondaryRef{BaseContext}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseContext}} to track
the information that is retained from each request for the following request.
The \secondaryRef{BaseContext}{BaseContext} class itself provides no functionality.
\secondaryEnd{}
\secondaryStart{BaseFilterService}
The \secondaryRef{BaseFilterService}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseFilterService}}
class is a subclass of \secondaryRef{BaseInputOutputService}{BaseInputOutputService}
that provides implementations of several of the required methods of its superclass.\\

Classes derived from \secondaryRef{BaseFilterService}{BaseFilterService} are expected to
fill in the `protected' member variables \asCode{\textunderscore{}inDescriptions} and
\asCode{\textunderscore{}outDescriptions}, which are used by the methods
\asCode{setUpInputStreams} and \asCode{setUpOutputStreams}, respectively.
The method \asCode{setUpStreamDescriptions} must be implemented in classes derived from
\secondaryRef{BaseFilterService}{BaseFilterService} and should fill in
\asCode{\textunderscore{}inDescriptions} and \asCode{\textunderscore{}outDescriptions}.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseFilterService}}
\secondaryStart{BaseInputHandler}
Instances of derived classes of
\secondaryRef{BaseService}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseInputHandler}} are responsible for
responding to input data on \yarp{} network connections.
They must implement the method \asCode{handleInput}, which is called when a complete
message has been received on a connection.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseInputHandler}}
\secondaryStart{BaseInputOutputService}
The \secondaryRef{BaseInputOutputService}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseInputOutputService}}
class is designed to support easy access to multiple instances of the same service, each
of which can be used to provide an interface to an external device or to a simple
flow--through operation.\\

Classes derived from \secondaryRef{BaseInputOutputService}{BaseInputOutputService} are
required to provide implementations of the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\asCode{configure}} This method is invoked when a
\requestsNameR{\inputOutput{}}{InputOutput}{configure} request is sent to the service; it
is responsible for setting attributes of the input and output streams of the service
\item \textbf{\asCode{restartStreams}} This method is invoked when a
\requestsNameR{\inputOutput{}}{InputOutput}{restartStreams} request is sent to the
service; it is responsible for stopping and then starting the input and output streams of
the service
\item \textbf{\asCode{setUpStreamDescriptions}} This method is invoked when the service is
started and it is responsible for providing a list of port names and protocols for use by
the current instance of the service
\item \textbf{\asCode{startStreams}} This method is invoked when a
\requestsNameR{\inputOutput{}}{InputOutput}{startStreams} request is sent to the service;
it is responsible for starting the input and output streams of the service
\item \textbf{\asCode{stopStreams}} This method is invoked when a
\requestsNameR{\inputOutput{}}{InputOutput}{stopStreams} request is sent to the service;
it is responsible for stopping the input and output streams of the service
\end{itemize}
The \asCode{configure}, \asCode{restartStreams}, \asCode{startStreams} and
\asCode{stopStreams} methods can also be invoked by code that instantiates the service.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseInputOutputService}}
\secondaryStart{BaseInputService}
The \secondaryRef{BaseInputService}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseInputService}}
class is a subclass of \secondaryRef{BaseInputOutputService}{BaseInputOutputService}
that provides implementations of several of the required methods of its superclass and is
specialized to only support output streams.\\

Classes derived from \secondaryRef{BaseFilterService}{BaseInputService} are expected to
fill in the `protected' member variable \asCode{\textunderscore{}outDescriptions}, which
is used by the method \asCode{setUpOutputStreams}.
The method \asCode{setUpStreamDescriptions} must be implemented in classes derived from
\secondaryRef{BaseInputService}{BaseInputService} and should fill in
\asCode{\textunderscore{}outDescriptions}.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseInputService}}
\secondaryStart{BaseMatcher}
The \secondaryRef{BaseMatcher}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseMatcher}} class represents a
`handle' to a top--down pattern matcher used by the
\serviceNameR[Service~Registry]{ServiceRegistry} to convert the arguments of
\requestsNameR{Service~Registry}{ServiceRegistry}{match} requests into \asCode{SQL}
operations.
The `outermost' matcher that is parsed from the original request is used to generate the
\asCode{SQL} -- the \secondaryRef{BaseMatcher}{BaseMatcher} class acts as a placeholder.
\secondaryEnd{}
\secondaryStart{BaseOutputService}
The \secondaryRef{BaseOutputService}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseOutputService}}
class is a subclass of \secondaryRef{BaseInputOutputService}{BaseInputOutputService}
that provides implementations of several of the required methods of its superclass and is
specialized to only support input streams.\\

Classes derived from \secondaryRef{BaseOutputService}{BaseOutputService} are expected to
fill in the `protected' member variable \asCode{\textunderscore{}inDescriptions}, which is
used by the method \asCode{setUpInputStreams}.
The method \asCode{setUpStreamDescriptions} must be implemented in classes derived from
\secondaryRef{BaseOutputService}{BaseOutputService} and should fill in
\asCode{\textunderscore{}inDescriptions}.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseOutputService}}
\secondaryStart{BaseRequestHandler}
The \secondaryRef{BaseRequestHandler}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseRequestHandler}} class is
designed to provide a consistent request handling mechanism for \mplusm{} services.\\

Classes derived from \secondaryRef{BaseRequestHandler}{BaseRequestHandler} are required to
provide implementations of the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\asCode{fillInAliases}} This method is invoked when a service is registering
its request handlers; it is responsible for providing a list of alternative names for the
request
\item \textbf{\asCode{fillInDescription}} This method is invoked when a service is
responding to an \requestsNameR{Basic}{Basic}{info} or a
\requestsNameR{Basic}{Basic}{list} request; it is responsible for providing a detailed
description of the request
\item \textbf{\asCode{processRequest}} This method is invoked with the request is seen by
the service and it is responsible for performing the operations that correspond to the
request
\end{itemize}
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseRequestHandler}}
\secondaryStart{BaseService}
Instances of derived classes of
\secondaryRef{BaseService}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseService}} are responsible for
responding to requests from corresponding instances of derived classes of
\secondaryRef{BaseClient}{BaseClient}.
As well, they can respond on their secondary \yarp{} network connections to requests or
process data from the secondary connections.

Requests are mainly handled by instances of derived classes of the
\secondaryRef{BaseRequestHandler}{BaseRequestHandler} class that are owned by the service
instance; the \secondaryRef{BaseService}{BaseService} class manages the standard request
handlers.\\

Classes derived from \secondaryRef{BaseService}{BaseService} should implement the
following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\asCode{attachRequestHandlers}} This method should be called in the
constructor for the service class and should register handlers for its custom requests
\item \textbf{\asCode{detachRequestHandlers}} This method should be called in the
destructor for the service class and should unregister handlers for its custom requests
\item \textbf{\asCode{start}} This method is invoked by the service application and should
invoke the same method of its parent class; it should set up any special conditions that
are needed by the service
\item \textbf{\asCode{stop}} This method is invoked by the service application and should
invoke the same method of its parent class; it should release any resources used by the
service
\end{itemize}
The following methods are available to code that uses
\secondaryRef{BaseService}{BaseService} classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\asCode{gatherMetrics}} This method returns a list of the metrics for the
connections associated with the service
\item \textbf{\asCode{getEndpoint}} This method provides access to the
\secondaryRef{Endpoint}{Endpoint} that is provided for the service and is useful for
establishing a connection to an `embedded' service
\end{itemize}
The following convenience methods are available to derived classes of
\secondaryRef{BaseService}{BaseService}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\asCode{addContext}} This method is used to record the data that holds the
persistent state for a connection
\item \textbf{\asCode{clearContexts}} This method is used to remove all the persistent
state for connections

\end{itemize}
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseService}}
\secondaryStart{Endpoint}
Instances of the \secondaryRef{Endpoint}{\classNameP{Common}{Endpoint}} class manage a
\yarp{} network connection for a service.
They are used to simplify the communication mechanisms that each service must provide and
to standardize on the mid--level protocols that \mplusm{} services and clients share.
\secondaryEnd{}
