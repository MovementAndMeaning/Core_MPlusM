\primaryStart[ClassesAndTheirInterfaces]{Classes~and~Their~Interfaces}
The \mplusm{} classes are organized into seven namespaces:
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{\mplusm{}::Common} classes that support all the \mplusm{} activities
\item\exSp\textbf{\mplusm{}::Example} classes that demonstrate features of \mplusm{}
\item\exSp\textbf{\mplusm{}::Parser} classes that are used by the
\requestsNameR{Registry~Service}{RegistryService}{match} request of the
\serviceNameR[Registry~Service]{RegistryService}
\item\exSp\textbf{\mplusm{}::Registry} classes that work with the internal database to
manage the \mplusm{} services
\item\exSp\textbf{\mplusm{}::RequestCounter} classes that support measuring the
performance of an \mplusm{} installation
\item\exSp\textbf{\mplusm{}::Test} classes that are used during unit\longDash{}testing of
the \mplusm{} source code
\item\exSp\textbf{\mplusm{}::Utilities} classes that are used only with the \mplusm{}
utility programs
\end{itemize}
There are 38 classes or structures in the \textbf{\mplusm{}::Common} namespace, 27 in
\textbf{\mplusm{}::Example}, 8 in \textbf{\mplusm{}::Parser}, 14 in
\textbf{\mplusm{}::Registry}, 6 in \textbf{\mplusm{}::RequestCounter}, 20 in
\textbf{\mplusm{}::Test} and 3 in \textbf{\mplusm{}::Utilities}.
The following sections describe the most critical of the classes in the
\textbf{\mplusm{}::Common} namespace \longDash{} many of the other classes, in all the
namespaces, derive from these classes. 
\secondaryStart{BaseAdapterData}
The class \secondaryRef{BaseAdapterData}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseAdapterData}} is used to
provide common methods and variables for data that is shared between instances of
derived classes of \secondaryRef{BaseService}{BaseService} and instances of derived
classes of \classNameR{Common}{BaseInputHandler}.
In particular, the shared data includes the activation state of the input stream and the
primary output stream to use when responding to input data.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseAdapterData}}
\secondaryStart{BaseClient}
Instances of derived classes of \secondaryRef{BaseClient}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseClient}}
are responsible for mediating \mplusm{} communication with corresponding instances of
derived classes of \secondaryRef{BaseService}{BaseService}.\\

The bulk of the mechanisms needed to perform this are provided by the
\secondaryRef{BaseClient}{BaseClient} class itself, and the derived classes need only
provide service\longDash{}specific routines, such as \asCode{getOneRandomNumber()},
which is a method of the \asCode{M+M::Example::RandomNumberClient} class.\\

The following methods are available to code that uses
\secondaryRef{BaseClient}{BaseClient} classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item\asBoldCode{FindMatchingService} This static function is provided for the use of
utility programs that need to identify active services
\item\exSp\asBoldCode{addAssociatedChannel} Adapter applications use this method to inform
the \serviceNameR[Registry~Service]{RegistryService} about their input and output \yarp{}
network connections
\item\exSp\asBoldCode{connectToService} This method is use by clients to establish a
connection to the endpoint of their companion service
\item\exSp\asBoldCode{disconnectFromService} This method is used by clients to release the
connection to their companion service
\item\exSp\asBoldCode{findService} This method is used by clients to locate the channel to
be used for communication with their companion service
\item\exSp\asBoldCode{reconnectIfDisconnected} This method is used by clients to
re\longDash{}establish a dropped connection with their companion service
\item\exSp\asBoldCode{removeAssociatedChannels} Adapter applications use this method to
inform the \serviceNameR[Registry~Service]{RegistryService} that their input and output
\yarp{} network connections are no longer available
\item\exSp\asBoldCode{send} This method is used by clients to send a request to their
companion service
\end{itemize}
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseClient}}
\secondaryStart{BaseContext}
Instances of derived classes of \secondaryRef{BaseService}{BaseService} that have \yarp{}
network connections with persistent state use instances of
derived classes of \secondaryRef{BaseContext}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseContext}} to track
the information that is retained from each request for the following request.
The \secondaryRef{BaseContext}{BaseContext} class itself provides no functionality.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseContext}}
\secondaryStart{BaseFilterService}
The \secondaryRef{BaseFilterService}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseFilterService}}

fill in the `protected' member variables \asCode{\textunderscore{}inDescriptions} and
\asCode{\textunderscore{}outDescriptions}, which are used by the methods
\asCode{setUpInputStreams} and \asCode{setUpOutputStreams}, respectively.
The method \asCode{setUpStreamDescriptions} must be implemented in classes derived from
\secondaryRef{BaseFilterService}{BaseFilterService} and should fill in
\asCode{\textunderscore{}inDescriptions} and \asCode{\textunderscore{}outDescriptions}.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseFilterService}}

message has been received on a connection.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseInputHandler}}
\secondaryStart{BaseInputOutputService}
The \secondaryRef{BaseInputOutputService}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseInputOutputService}}
class is designed to support easy access to multiple instances of the same service, each
of which can be used to provide an interface to an external device or to a simple
flow\longDash{}through operation.\\

Classes derived from \secondaryRef{BaseInputOutputService}{BaseInputOutputService} are
required to provide implementations of the following methods:

\requestsNameR{\inputOutput{}}{InputOutput}{stopStreams} request is sent to the service;
it is responsible for stopping the input and output streams of the service
\end{itemize}
The \asCode{configure}, \asCode{restartStreams}, \asCode{startStreams} and
\asCode{stopStreams} methods can also be invoked by code that instantiates the service.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseInputOutputService}}
\secondaryStart{BaseInputService}
The \secondaryRef{BaseInputService}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseInputService}}
class is a subclass of \secondaryRef{BaseInputOutputService}{BaseInputOutputService}
that provides implementations of several of the required methods of its superclass and is
specialized to only support output streams.\\

Classes derived from \secondaryRef{BaseFilterService}{BaseInputService} are expected to
fill in the `protected' member variable \asCode{\textunderscore{}outDescriptions}, which
is used by the method \asCode{setUpOutputStreams}.
The method \asCode{setUpStreamDescriptions} must be implemented in classes derived from
\secondaryRef{BaseInputService}{BaseInputService} and should fill in
\asCode{\textunderscore{}outDescriptions}.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseInputService}}
\secondaryStart{BaseMatcher}
The \secondaryRef{BaseMatcher}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseMatcher}} class represents a
`handle' to a top\longDash{}down pattern matcher used by the
\serviceNameR[Registry~Service]{RegistryService} to convert the arguments of
\requestsNameR{Registry~Service}{RegistryService}{match} requests into \asCode{SQL}
operations.
The `outermost' matcher that is parsed from the original request is used to generate the
\asCode{SQL} \longDash{} the \secondaryRef{BaseMatcher}{BaseMatcher} class acts as a
placeholder.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseMatcher}}

\asCode{\textunderscore{}inDescriptions}.
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseOutputService}}
\secondaryStart{BaseRequestHandler}
The \secondaryRef{BaseRequestHandler}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseRequestHandler}} class is

Classes derived from \secondaryRef{BaseRequestHandler}{BaseRequestHandler} are required to
provide implementations of the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item\asBoldCode{fillInAliases} This method is invoked when a service is registering its
request handlers; it is responsible for providing a list of alternative names for the
request
\item\exSp\asBoldCode{fillInDescription} This method is invoked when a service is

request
\end{itemize}
\secondaryEnd{\classNameE{Common}{BaseRequestHandler}}
\secondaryStart{BaseService}
Instances of derived classes of
\secondaryRef{BaseService}{\classNameP{Common}{BaseService}} are responsible for
responding to requests from corresponding instances of derived classes of
\secondaryRef{BaseClient}{BaseClient}.
As well, they can respond on their secondary \yarp{} network connections to requests or
process data from the secondary connections.

Requests are mainly handled by instances of derived classes of the
\secondaryRef{BaseRequestHandler}{BaseRequestHandler} class that are owned by the service
instance; the \secondaryRef{BaseService}{BaseService} class manages the standard request
handlers.\\
